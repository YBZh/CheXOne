D. Pericardial effusion","The cardiac silhouette's size is evaluated by comparing it to standard anatomical references visible on the chest X-ray. The heart's shape appears symmetric without signs of enlargement (e.g., no left or right ventricular hypertrophy), but its dimensions approach the threshold of normality. There is no evidence of fluid accumulation (pericardial effusion) or structural abnormalities (e.g., masses) altering the contour. The most accurate conclusion aligns with a cardiac silhouette that is neither definitively enlarged nor entirely normal, pointing to a borderline assessment.
